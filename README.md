# Password Security Checker

Welcome to the Password Security Checker GitHub repository! This tool is designed to enhance online security by checking how often your commonly used passwords have been compromised. As passwords remain a critical aspect of digital security from ancient times to the modern internet era, understanding their vulnerabilities is key to safeguarding your personal and professional data.

## About the Project

This project provides a utility that interacts with the Have I Been Pwned API to check the exposure of your passwords in previous data breaches. Given the importance of strong, unique passwords for online security, this tool aims to help users evaluate the strength and compromise status of their passwords.

### Key Features

- **Compromise Assessment**: Determines how many times a password has appeared in data breaches, giving you a clear indication of its security level.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly sends requests to the Have I Been Pwned API to retrieve detailed information about password breaches.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an easy-to-use interface that requires minimal setup to perform password checks.

### How It Works

The tool sends hashed versions of passwords to the Have I Been Pwned API to ensure privacy and security. It then processes the API's response to determine how often the password hash has appeared in known data breaches, allowing you to make informed decisions about changing or updating your passwords.
